> Illustrate abstracting details with Terraform modules.

## Summary

In the following repo, I illustrate how to create higher-level Terraform modules that alleviate the burden of gritty and details by creating lower-level Terraform modules that apply reasonable defaults.

As the module number increases, the level of abstraction increases and the quantity of gritty details decreases because the lower-level modules handle lower-lever details—alleviates burden. This flow also illustrates that as you decrease abstration, then the quantity of details increases—more arduous.
